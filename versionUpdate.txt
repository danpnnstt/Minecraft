Fixed this version:

- Prompts for directory if no command line parameter specified
- Now adds a final directory separation character ('\') if the path does not include one
- Added debugging output (need to remove before final release)
- The op list and whitelist list boxes now refresh when the Add/Edit/Delete options are used
- Corrected bug where Delete option would not work for Op list or Whitelist
- Changes made to a group's permissions are not actually recorded until the 'Save Changes' button is clicked (this prevents the auto-write to file)
- Changes made to a group's membership (the player list) is recorded immediately, but is not written to file until the 'Save Changes' button is clicked
- Changes made to the server properties tab are recorded immediately, but are not written to file until the 'Save to file' button is clicked
- Added 'Reload from file' option for the Permissions tab
- All other changes made in the program are immediately written to file
- Implemented Add user to Op list, however they are always given level 4 permissions
- Implemented Add user to Whitelist

still need to do:
- Correct Op level to reflect whatever default is set in server.properties
- On the permissions tab, disable all options if an option is not selected in the group drop-down
- Enable the parent tab to change the parent name
- Enable the group name textbox to allow user to change the name of the group (also changes the name of the file)


Once all of this is done, create Java version of the application & verify it runs on Linux.

Idea: Perform an OS scan at program launch to launch the correct version?!?

Idea: Implement system scan at program launch to locate the install directory.  Searches for server.properties, eula.txt, and minecraft_server.1.7.10.jar.  If these files are missing, displays a warning to the user and exits.


Create "downloads" tab and include links to all versions of the program:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/1.7.10/1.7.10.jar
https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/1.7.10/minecraft_server.1.7.10.jar
